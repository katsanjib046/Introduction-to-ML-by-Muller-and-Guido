    "Picking the right network architecture is more of an art than a science, and only practice can help you become an expert neural-network architect. Below we shall work through several examples illustrating different classification and regression tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some general guidelines/best practices to keep in mind are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The input data has to be in tensor format, whose shape needs to be explicitly specified in the input layer. The terminology for the three key tensor attributes:\n",
    "  * **rank** or **number of axes**: number of matrix indices, check with .ndim\n",
    "  * **dimension**: number of entries for each index, check with .shape\n",
    "  * **data type**: what type of data is contained in the tensor, check with .dtype\n",
    "2. Data labelling conventions\n",
    "  * **vector data**: the first axis (axis 0) is the samples axis, so a typical dataset is a 2D tensor of shape (samples, features). Typically processed with **dense** or **fully-connected** layers.\n",
    "  * **timeseries data**: when one of the variables is time, then a 3D tensor of shape (samples, timesteps, features). By convention, time is on axis 1. Typically processed with **recurrent** or **LSTM** layers. \n",
    "  * **images**: 4D tensors of shape (samples, height, width, channels) with 1 channel for grayscale images and 3 channels for color images. Be aware of different conventions (channels-last in TensorFlor and channels-first in Theano). Keras supports both formats. Typically processed with **2D convolution** layers. \n",
    "  * **video**: 5D tensors of shape (samples, frames, height, width, channels). \n",
    "3. The notion of data batches. Typically, deep-learning models do not process the entire dataset at once; rather the data is broken into small batches formed at random. The three alternatives are:\n",
    "  * **True SGD**: use a single sample at each iteration (too random)\n",
    "  * **Batch SGD**: use the full dataset at each iteration (too slow)\n",
    "  * **Mini-batch SGD**: use a mini-batch of a fixed size (good compromise)\n",
    "4. There are several variants of SGD which can be used as optimizers. They differ from SGD by taking into account previous weight updates when computing the next weight update, and not just the current state of the system. Many of them use **momentum**, which can increase convergence rate and avoid getting stuck in local minima. The common optimizers are:\n",
    "  * **RMSprop**: uses an adaptive learning rate instead of treating it as a fixed hyperparameter. It decreases the step for large gradients to avoid exploding, and increases the step for small gradients to avoid stalling. \n",
    "  * **SGD with momentum**: <a href=\"https://distill.pub/2017/momentum/\">Why momentum really works</a>\n",
    "5. Epochs: the number of iterations over **all** of the training data. Also needs to be chosen wisely:\n",
    "  * if too many, run the risk of overtraining\n",
    "  * if too few, run the risk of not learning.\n",
    "6. Topology of the neural network: how the layers are organized.\n",
    "  * **Sequential**: a linear stack of layers.\n",
    "  * **Multi-branch networks**, **multihead networks**, etc.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Try training with the default layer configuration (4+2). Notice how the neurons in the first layer learn simple patterns while the neurons in the second layer learn to combine those into more complex patterns. Can you successfully classify each of the 4 datasets?\n",
    "2. In general, the more layers there are, the more complex the patterns can be. Try adding some more layers and see if this expectation holds true.\n",
    "3. Explore the effect of different activation functions. For example, compare the default tanh with ReLU. Notice that typically ReLU finds the solution faster, but the boundaries are linear, which is due to the shape of the ReLU function.\n",
    "4. The risk of local minima. Simplify the network architecture to a single layer with just 3 neurons. Train it multiple times (you may also try different activation functions). To reset the weights, click the Reset button to the left of the Play button. Notice how the training time varies a lot, and sometimes it even gets stuck in a local minimum.\n",
    "5. What happens when the neural network is too small? Which datasets can you classify with only two neurons? With a single neuron?\n",
    "6. What happens when the neural network is too large? Set the number of neurons to eight and train multiple times. Notice that now for the easy datasets it is consistently fast and never gets stuck in a local minimum. This illustrates an important finding in neural network theory: large neural networks rarely get stuck in local minima, and even when they do, these local minima are almost as good as the global one.\n",
    "7. The swirl dataset is a tough challenge. A single layer, even with as many as 8 neurons, has a hard time classifying it correctly. One potential solution is feature engineering - feed all 7 properties of the two features into the network.\n",
    "8. The risk of vanishing gradients in deep networks. Focus again on the swirl dataset and change the architecture to 4 layers with 8 neurons each. Notice that training takes much longer and often gets stuck on plateaus for long periods of time. Also notice that neurons in the highest layers (on the right) tend to evolve faster than the neurons in the lowest layers (on the left). This is a manifestation of the so called **vanishing gradients problem**.  \n",

    "Overfitting happens in every machine-learning problem - the performance of the model on the held-out validation data peaks after a certain number of epochs and then starts degrading. **Learning how to deal with overfitting is essential to mastering machine learning.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental issue in machine learning is the tension between **optimization** and **generalization**. \n",
    "* **Optimization** refers to the process of adjusting a model to get the best performance possible on the training data (the \"learning\" part of \"machine learning\").\n",
    "* **Generalization** refers to how well the trained model would perform on data it has never seen before. The goal of the game is to get good generalization, of course, but we do not control generalization; we can only adjust the model based on its training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in the IMDB example above, training proceeds in two stages:\n",
    "1. **The model is under-fit.** At the beginning of training, optimization and generalization are correlated: the lower the loss on training data, the lower the loss on test data. While this is happening, the model is said to be under-fit: there is still progress to be made; the network hasn't yet modeled all relevant patterns in the training data. \n",
    "2. **The model is overfit.** After a certain number of iterations on the training data, generalization stops improving, validation metrics stall then start degrading: the model is then starting to over-fit, i.e. it is starting to learn patterns that are specific to the training data but that are misleading or irrelevant when it comes to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The four most common ways to deal with overfitting are\n",
    "1. Increase the amount of training data (or if not possible, reduce the number of epochs).\n",
    "2. Reduce the capacity of the network.\n",
    "3. Add weight regularization.\n",
    "4. Add dropout.\n"

    "The simplest way to prevent overfitting is to reduce the size of the model, i.e. the number of learnable parameters in the model (which in turn is determined by the number of layers and the number of units per layer). In deep learning, the number of learnable parameters in a model is often referred to as the model's **capacity**. For optimal performance, you need to find the right balance between \"too much capacity\" and \"not enough capacity\":\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Too much capacity.** Intuitively, a model with more parameters will have more \"memorization capacity\" and therefore will be able to easily learn a perfect dictionary-like mapping between training samples and their targets, a mapping without any generalization power. Always keep this in mind: deep learning models tend to be good at fitting to the training data, but the real challenge is generalization, not fitting.\n",
    "2. **Insufficient capacity.** On the other hand, if the network has limited memorization resources, it will not be able to learn this mapping as easily, and thus, in order to minimize its loss, it will have to resort to learning compressed representations that have predictive power regarding the targets -- precisely the type of representations that we are interested in. At the same time, keep in mind that you should be using models that have enough parameters that they won't be underfitting: your model shouldn't be starved for memorization resources. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, **there is no magical formula** to determine what the right number of layers is, or what the right size for each layer is. You will have to evaluate an array of different architectures (on your validation set, not on your test set, of course) in order to find the right model size for your data. The general workflow to find an appropriate model size is to start with relatively few layers and parameters, and start increasing the size of the layers or adding new layers until you see diminishing returns with regard to the validation loss."

    "**Dropout** is one of the most effective and most commonly used regularization techniques for neural networks, developed by Geoff Hinton and his students at the University of Toronto. Geoff Hinton has said that he was inspired, among other things, by a fraud prevention mechanism used by banks -- in his own words: \"I went to my bank. The tellers kept changing and I asked one of them why. He said he didn’t know but they got moved around a lot. I figured it must be because it would require cooperation between employees to successfully defraud the bank. This made me realize that randomly removing a different subset of neurons on each example would prevent conspiracies and thus reduce overfitting\"."

    "**Rough explanation**: Dropout, applied to a layer, consists of randomly \"dropping out\" (i.e. setting to zero) a number of output features of the layer during training. Let's say a given layer would normally have returned a vector [0.2, 0.5, 1.3, 0.8, 1.1] for a given input sample during training; after applying dropout, this vector will have a few zero entries distributed at random, e.g. [0, 0.5, 1.3, 0, 1.1]. The \"dropout rate\" is the fraction of the features that are being zeroed-out; it is usually set between 0.2 and 0.5. At test time, no units are dropped out, and instead the layer's output values are scaled down by a factor equal to the dropout rate, so as to balance for the fact that more units are active than at training time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why would this trick help?** The core idea is that introducing noise in the output values of a layer can break up happenstance patterns that are not significant (what Hinton refers to as \"conspiracies\"), which the network would start memorizing if no noise was present."
